Two Pages:
Page 1:
This page will feature a counter button that increments upon each click.
Adjacent to the button, the current number will be displayed.
If the number is odd, the background color will be green; if even, the background color will be blue.
Additionally, there will be a link to navigate to Page 2.
 
i click on button 18 and color green
 
Page 2:
Page 2 will simply display the text selected on Page 1, followed by the number e.g 10 and the color blue
A link will be provided to return to Page 1.
Upon returning to Page 1, the user will resume from where they left off.
 
This implementation will leverage ReactJS components and React Router DOM for seamless navigation between the two pages, maintaining state and continuity throughout the user's journey
